                        <p class="paragraphs">“The only thing a person can ever really do is keep moving forward. Take that big leap forward without hesitation, without once looking back. Simply forget the past and forge toward the future.” - Alyson Noel</p>
                        <br>
                          <p class="paragraphs">I think this quote is both wrong and correct in different ways. Like most people, I haven’t always been successful in everything I have set out to do. Of course instead of letting failure deter us from a possible action, we should move forward. But the part of the quote I don’t agree with is forgetting the past and leaping forward without hesitation. Failure is a necessary part of the journey as it teaches us that we aren’t perfect and we still have room for improvement. Failure helps us look back on specific events and allows us to see what we could have done differently. By reflecting, we could see where we acted in the wrong way, so we can fix it and act in a better way next time. By simply forgetting the past, we would see no growth and risk failure again.</p>

            <P class="paragraphs">My name is Christian De La Torre. I am currently in the transition from college to high school. For my whole life, I have lived in Queens, New York in a two parent household with 6 other siblings. I attended Benajmin N. Cardozo High School where I took multiple AP Classes to try and challenge myself. I am also in the All Star Code Summer Intensive this summer.</P>

            <li>3D Printing</li>
            <p class="paragraphs">3D-Printing always piqued my interest as it gave me a way to create some of my favorite props in movies at home. I find it fun to find files for something like a helmet or prop like a Batarang and print it out on my 3D-Printer. Then I sand it down to get a smooth finish and try my hand at painting it to look more like the prop.
            </p>
            <li>Soldering</li>
            <p class="paragraphs">Soldering became a hobby for me when I tried to install a prop replica of Darth Maul’s Lightsaber with electronics. Normal electronics didn’t pick up motion very well, which made me want to buy a custom soundboard that would allow me to have the lightsaber make different sounds and different colors.Soldering allowed me to use wire to connect a set of components like recharge port to the soundboard, so that everything would run smoothly. Now I solder to complete other lightsaber replicas with electronics.

            <li>Star Wars</li>
            <p class="paragraphs">I have always been obsessed with the Star Wars Franchise.From a young age, I always watched all the shows and even read the comics and books.Star Wars teaches us to always strive for doing good and pushing yourself to not give into our darker thoughts of selfishness, which was a powerful message to me. Just knowing everything by reading, playing, and watching the different Star Wars content allows me a nice break.
            </p>
            <li>Superhero Genre</li>
            <p class="paragraphs">The superhero genre is my favorite genre. I grew up watching all the animated cartoons, such Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League: Unlimited. As with Star Wars, I grew up reading the comics on the different heroes and playing the games. My favorite movies are from the MCU and I love watching the new content to keep me entertained.

        <h3>Employment</h3>
            <li>STEM SUCCESS</li>
            <p class="paragraphs">During my time at the Summer Youth Employment Program, 
                I decided to challenge myself by choosing to work for Stem Success INC.
                rather than getting an office job. I stepped out of my comfort zone by
                teaching the STEM related skill of video production to the students of underprivileged communities. 
                The STEM based skill that my boss had chosen for my group was video production and I was assigned to be one of two people to learn the skill and teach it to the students of that underprivileged community. 
                I researched multiple sites and programs that dealt with the editing part of video production and made sure that the programs were free and very user-friendly by seeing the different reviews and comparing the layout of each program.
                My idea was that I should teach two different softwares as the students can get the basic features and the more advanced features. 
                As I was teaching little kids about video production,  I tried to make my lessons very easy to follow by not using big words and showing where the specific icons were. 
                Instead of using just the PowerPoint, I would use the software live and they could see everything I was doing and could ask questions while I was doing it. Overall, the lessons I prepared were received well and I could tell that the children learned something as they sent videos of their own creation and I saw everything I taught them utilized, such as adding titles and adjusting audio.
            </p>
            <li>WLG Environmental Corp</li>
            <p class="paragraphs">The program focused on learning about environmental issues and seeing how we could reduce the damage to the environment in our own lives. 
                I worked at Kehilat Sephardim Food Pantry through WLG Environmental Corp. 
                I came to the pantry to take photos and videos of the pantry daily operations. 
                I would also help out around the pantry by bagging food and helping distribute it on the line. 
                Then, I would edit a video from the footage that informs our clients of our work and services. 
                I also made volunteering videos to try and market to people who would potentially want to volunteer as they would see what it would look like to volunteer with the pantry.
            </p>
        <h3>Leadership Roles</h3>
            <li>Kehilat Sephardim Food Pantry | Supervisor|</li>
            <p>March 6, 2022– Present </p>
            <p class="paragraphs">I was responsible for guiding multiple volunteers onto roles that would be crucial to make sure pantry operations would run smoothly. 
                I handled different types of food, such as produce, and sorted through them to make sure the food was kept in the right conditions and were of good quality to distribute. 
                I managed volunteers through taking attendance, making sure everyone had a role, creating name tags, and making sure we alternated volunteers in case they needed a break.
            </p>
            <li>Junior One Hundred Legacy Program | Participant | </li>
            <p>January 5, 2022 – May 29, 2022</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">The program taught financial literacy that included investment methods and business practices to minorities in order to prepare us for the future. 
                I was chosen to be the leader of a team when we played the Stock Market Game. 
                I was responsible for making sure that my team members would do the work they were required to and coordinating the team into making decisions with our stock portfolio.
